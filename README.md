# E-Expression-Evaluator-Using-Unlimited-Integers-and-Unlimited-Rationals-

– Implemented an Unlimited Integer data type which can perform fundamental arithmetic operations on integers of possibly very large sizes bringing into use the knowledge of object oriented programming.
– Implemented an Unlimited Rationals data type using the Unlimited Integer data type in order to handle rationals of unlimited precisions and scenarios where traditional integer types fall short due to size limitations.
- With the use of Unlimited Integers and Unlimited Rationals data types, created a new language which can evaluate multiple expressions given by user by tokenizing them, creating a parse tree for tokenized expression and storing the value of a variable in a Binary Search Tree.
